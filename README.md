# DOM

## The concepts

## The DOM tree

The Document Object Model allows us to visualize any HTML document as a "tree". The tree is made of nodes, being the different HTML elements in the page. Each document consists of a root node, which contains all the subsequent child nodes.

![Dom](tree.svg)

A node containing one or many nodes will be called a parent node whilst the contained nodes will be named children nodes.

## Text nodes

At the end of the line we find text nodes. Those are special nodes that cannot bear a child, nor have attributes. For example :

<p>Hello</p>
Here we have p node containing a Hello textnode

## Other nodes

Attributes can also be manipulated as nodes. HTML comments as well.

## Accessing the DOM using Javascript

There are some predifined Javascript objects in your browser. The DOM is one of them. If you open a console and type in document. you'll see a list of accessors to the DOM tree.

Your exploration starts here...

## Exercises:

![dom2](treetocode.png)

What would be the corresponding HTML code for the tree drawn above?
Open the index.html and try to draw the corresponding DOM tree (either on a drawing app, or with plain old pen and paper)
Edit the script.js to
Display the document title in the console
Change the document title to Modifying the DOM
Using the children method and a for ... of loop, display every children elements of the second child element of your document (display all children elements of the <body>)
Change the background color of the body with a random color. (tip: You can use the rgb() notation and 3 random-generated numbers between 0 and 255).
